<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crude Heparin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pig Intestine Mucosa Heparin</li><li>Bovine Heparin and Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The crude heparin market is primarily categorized into three types: pig intestine mucosa heparin, bovine heparin, and others. Pig intestine mucosa heparin is the most widely used source due to its high yield and efficacy. Bovine heparin, derived from cow lungs, serves as an alternative, though concerns about disease transmission have limited its use. Other sources may include synthetic or recombinant heparins. Each type varies in terms of extraction methods, availability, and regulatory considerations, affecting their market dynamics and applications.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Crude Heparin Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)</li><li>Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin (LMWH)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The crude heparin market primarily serves as a source for unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). UFH is utilized for its rapid anticoagulation effects, often in hospitals for surgeries or acute thromboembolic disorders. In contrast, LMWH, derived from UFH through depolymerization, offers more predictable pharmacokinetics and is used for outpatient management of conditions like deep vein thrombosis. Together, these forms of heparin play crucial roles in preventing and treating various thromboembolic complications in clinical settings.</p></p>
