<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Melanoma Cancer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive melanoma</li><li>Invasive melanoma</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The melanoma cancer market is divided into two primary types: non-invasive melanoma and invasive melanoma. Non-invasive melanoma, often identified as melanoma in situ, features cancerous cells confined to the epidermis and has a higher cure rate due to early detection and treatment. Invasive melanoma, on the other hand, penetrates deeper layers of skin and can metastasize, making it more aggressive and difficult to treat. These distinctions significantly impact treatment strategies, patient outcomes, and market dynamics for therapies.</p></p>
