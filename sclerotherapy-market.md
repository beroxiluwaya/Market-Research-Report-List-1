<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sclerotherapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Detergents</li><li>Osmotic Agents</li><li>Chemical Irritants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sclerotherapy market comprises three main types: detergents, osmotic agents, and chemical irritants. Detergents, such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate, disrupt cell membranes, facilitating vein closure. Osmotic agents, like hypertonic saline, create an osmotic gradient that leads to tissue dehydration and vein collapse. Chemical irritants, including agents like ethanol, invoke a localized inflammatory response, promoting vessel obliteration. Each type serves specific needs in treating varicose veins and vascular malformations, reflecting diverse therapeutic approaches within sclerotherapy.</p></p>
