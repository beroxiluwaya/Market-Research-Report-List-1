<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 4,4'-ODA Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Recrystallization Type</li><li>Sublimation Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 4,4'-ODA market can be categorized into recrystallization and sublimation types. Recrystallization involves dissolving the compound in a solvent and then cooling it to promote crystal formation, resulting in high-purity 4,4'-ODA. The sublimation type, on the other hand, relies on transforming the solid directly into vapor, which is then cooled to form crystals. Both methods aim to purify and enhance the quality of 4,4'-ODA for applications in electronics, polymers, and advanced materials.</p></p>
